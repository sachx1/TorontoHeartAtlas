A growing collection of educational models created from cardiac-gated CT data of adult hearts, including from individuals with congenital heart disease. 
This project was supported by the Department of Anesthesia and Pain Management, Joint Department of Medical Imaging, Adult Congenital Cardiac Clinic and The Division of Cardiac Surgery at Toronto General Hospital, through a grant from the Peter Munk Cardiac Center Foundation.
The Atlas is created and maintained by the Lynn and Arnold Irwin Advanced Perioperative Imaging Lab.

Atlas models can be viewed in 3D at: https://sketchfab.com/jquahian/collections/toronto-heart-atlas

An index including the diagnosis and surgical history for each model will be available soon.
